        <h1>Africaâ€™s Would-Be Giant Careens Toward Crisis</h1>
        <h2>The focus on soccer in youth sports programs is exploding nation-wide</h2>
        <p>In the wake of the first World Cup in the US during the '90s, soccer's influence has steadily grown,
            particularly in women's soccer. This year, a staggering 3 million kids participated in youth soccer leagues,
            with a notable 2/3 of these leagues dedicated to girls. In the 12-17 age group, Major League Soccer (MLS)
            has eclipsed the Major League
            Baseball (MLB) and National Football League (NFL) in popularity.</p>
        <p>PA significant factor contributing to this meteoric rise is the substantial investment in the Women's World
            Cup games in 2014.
            Fox reaped $40 million from the women's games, attracting major advertisers such as ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon,
            Nike, and Visa.
            These industry giants are actively supporting the growth of soccer by investing in youth facilities and
            promoting programs nationwide. </p>
        <p>With big businesses backing the sport, the continued ascent of soccer's popularity across the country seems
            inevitable in the years to come. </p>
