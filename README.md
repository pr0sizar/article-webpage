## Africa’s Would-Be Giant Careens Toward Crisis
The focus on soccer in youth sports programs across the United States is rapidly expanding. After the first World Cup held in the US during the '90s, soccer’s influence has steadily grown, particularly in women’s soccer. This year, a staggering **3 million kids** participated in youth soccer leagues, with a notable **2/3 of these leagues dedicated to girls**. In the 12-17 age group, Major League Soccer (MLS) has surpassed Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Football League (NFL) in popularity.

A significant factor contributing to this meteoric rise is the substantial investment in the **Women’s World Cup games in 2014**. Fox reaped $40 million from the women’s games, attracting major advertisers such as ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, and Visa. These industry giants are actively supporting the growth of soccer by investing in youth facilities and promoting programs nationwide.

With big businesses backing the sport, the continued ascent of soccer’s popularity across the country seems inevitable in the years to come.
